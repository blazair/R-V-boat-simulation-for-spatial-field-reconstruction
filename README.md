# R-V-boat-simulation-for-spatial-field-reconstruction
The setup integrates ROS 2, Gazebo, and PX4 to enable active sampling, real-time Gaussian Process (GP) inference, and adaptive mapping of temperature or scalar fields. Includes CUDA-accelerated GP modules, sampling nodes, and utilities for evaluating reconstruction accuracy within dynamic marine simulation environments.
